# flask-rest-api
A simple RESTful API built using Flask, SQLAlchemy and Marshmallow that can used for basic CRUD operations on a SQlite database. It features a basic 'product' object (with simple attributes such as name, description, price and quantity), but can be extended. Based on Brad Traversy's example, done for educational purposes.
